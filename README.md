# Database educators' network
maintained by _[Antti Knutas](https://anttiknutas.net/)_ from LUT University under the [Älykkäät oppimisympäristöt](https://tim.jyu.fi/view/aalto/hankkeet/aly/opettajaverkostot/opettajaverkostot) project.

All contributed content (as seen from commit or wiki edit history) is owned by their respective contributors, until the network settles on a suitable open license.

## About the project
Currently all Finnish higher education institutions do high quality work, but often rather independently, which might lead to a lack of dissemination of good ideas or materials. To address the issue, this project exists to provide networking opportunities for database educators working in Finnish higher education organizations.

There are also other, [parallel networks](https://tim.jyu.fi/view/aalto/hankkeet/aly/opettajaverkostot/opettajaverkostot) for web programming and algorithms provided by the ÄlyOppi -project.

## Project participants and communication
The main communication channel currently is a shared mailing list and Zoom webinar series that will be arranged quarterly. Webinars and other news will be announced in the mailing list.
